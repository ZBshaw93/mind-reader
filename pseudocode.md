START

Main Goal:

Create a single page web app that plays a game with the user to read their mind.

Things to keep in mind:

* The focus is to use state management to progress forward to the next view, backward to the previous view, and reset to the first view on the page.
* By default, the app should prompt the user to click through the single-page app and see a new view for every step.
* You need to be able to scroll through the numbers to find your symbol (page 5 on the wireframe).

Objects:

1. Button to progress to next view.
2. Button to go backward to previous view.
3. Button to reset to first view on the page.
